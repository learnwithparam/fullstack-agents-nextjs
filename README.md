# Fullstack AI Agents with Next.js

![learnwithparam.com](https://www.learnwithparam.com/ai-bootcamp/opengraph-image)

Build a multi-step AI agent end to end in a single Next.js 15 app. The agent plans, calls tools, observes results, and streams natural-language answers back to a chat UI. Tools live next to the route handler, state streams through the Vercel AI SDK, and the whole thing ships as one deployable unit.

## What You'll Learn

- Design a multi-step agent loop using `streamText` with `maxSteps` so the model can call tools, observe, and reply in one turn
- Define typed tools with Zod schemas that the model can discover, call, and chain
- Wire `useChat` to render streaming text and tool invocations inline in a React 19 UI
- Run a Fullstack AI agent in one Next.js app (no separate Python service, no orchestration framework)
- Swap providers cleanly by routing through OpenRouter as the default gateway
- Ship with Docker, a Makefile, and a `.env.example` so the project is reproducible on any machine

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router, Turbopack) with **TypeScript** and **React 19**
- **Vercel AI SDK** (`ai`, `@ai-sdk/react`) for `streamText`, tools, and `useChat`
- **OpenRouter** (`@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`) as the default LLM gateway
- **Zod** for tool input schemas
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** + **lucide-react** for the UI
- **pnpm** for dependency management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and `pnpm` (installed automatically by `make setup`)
- An OpenRouter API key (free tier works for testing)

### Quick Start

```bash
make dev

# Or step by step:
make setup          # Install deps and create .env
# Edit .env with your OPENROUTER_API_KEY
make run            # Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000
```

### With Docker

```bash
make build
make up
make logs
make down
```

## API Routes

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/chat` | Multi-step agent with tool calling (`get_weather`, `calculator`, `web_search`), streamed via the AI SDK |

## Agent Tools

The agent has three tools wired up in `src/lib/agent-tools.ts`. All three are safe to run locally with no extra keys:

- `get_weather(city)` — Returns a mock weather payload for common cities
- `calculator(expression)` — Evaluates arithmetic expressions safely
- `web_search(query)` — Returns canned search snippets you can replace with a real provider

Try a prompt like: *"What's the weather in Tokyo and what's 47 * 23?"* — the agent will call `get_weather`, then `calculator`, then produce a single merged answer.

## Challenges

Work through these to go from a demo to a real agent:

1. **Tool calling basics** — Watch the model call `get_weather` and render the tool invocation card in the UI
2. **Multi-step reasoning** — Ask a question that needs two tools and confirm the agent chains them inside `maxSteps`
3. **Real weather tool** — Replace the mock with a real API (OpenWeather or WeatherAPI) and handle the error path
4. **Real search tool** — Swap the mock for Tavily, Brave, or SerpAPI and rank the results before returning them
5. **Streaming UX** — Show a live "Agent is calling tool X..." indicator while tool calls are in flight
6. **Guardrails** — Add an input allowlist for `calculator` and reject expressions that exceed a length budget
7. **Provider swap** — Route the agent through Mistral or Gemini by flipping `LLM_PROVIDER` and adding the matching SDK
8. **Memory** — Persist conversation history to a database so a user can resume a thread after a reload
